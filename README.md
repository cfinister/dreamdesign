# A Better Doctor Dream Application
![alt text](betterdoctorlogo.png "logo for better doc")
## Application Description
The **Better Doctor Application** is an app that allows users to not only find doctors in their area,
but also an application that can find doctors based on practices, if they take your
medical insurance, specialities they offer, and reviews from other patients.
An application like this is focused on healthcare, so the usage and simplicity
usability are __huge__ concerns for this application. Wanting this Application to
be easy to use and user friendly, in order to keep the users to come back time after
time when they need a doctor.

This application can be used on iOS devices with the latest software. This
application could be considered one used for a  _life critical systems_ or a
_industral and commercial uses_ application as it is used for healthcare, insurance,
and gaining information about conditions and doctors. This is a necessary Application,
as finding a **better** doctor is extremely important. Having a medical application
that is simple, clean, easy to learn is a necessity when it comes to usability.

Many of the applications out on the app store are nothing to do with medical use,
or have a problem with easy user to designer mental model. It is difficult for the users
to learn cues that will help them in finding a good doctor. Most apps lack in
efficiency and learnability, "The designers mental model has to link to the users
mental model to lead to success" (Shneiderman). Meaning that in order for
my "Better Doctor" App to work, this application must be easy enough for the users
to understand what I am asking for on my interface. They lack in quickly getting the answers
you need for insurance, providers and plans, as well as having issues in being a fast
application to use.


### Web Service(s) Used
The Better Doctor Application will run on JSON triggered calls. Some of the calls that will
be used within the application are (_click the name of the call to see a sample of it_):

1. [Doctor Search](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/yMKoxG) (`GET Doctor`):

   This call searches through the "better doctor" data and can search for first
   and last name (even partial spelling). The search can also provide information
   on what insurances this doctor accepts, the doctor's practice location,
   other doctors linked to that practice that the original doctor we have searched
   for is connected too, specialities, gender of doctor and the doctor's bio (this is called
    within the `get doctor/{uid}/bio`).

   This call is incredibly powerful and has most, if not all of the features that
   will be used within this application. An example of this is provided within
   the codepen, where a search of a last or first name will give all of the
   doctors information needed to decide if the doctor is right for you or not.
2. [Practice Search](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/MpVErw) (`GET Practices`):

   This call results in provider service locations, or the doctors offices. Searching
   by the name of the practice, searching the area provided, and can tell the users
   distance from the provider.

   Mainly used in helping provide information on location and implementation of
   the map feature included on the doctor's profile.
3. [Retrieve a List of Doctors at a Practice](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/MpVErw) (`GET practices/{uid}/doctors`):

   Returns a list of all doctors in a specific practice location. This is mainly
   used for convenience in order to see what doctors are connected to who,
   and what kinds of doctors you can see in that practice. Connected back to the
   `get practices` call, this is just solely used for getting a list of
   the doctors in that building.
4. [Retrieve a List of Specialities](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/peLWzY) (`GET specialities`):

   Results back a list of specialities that contain the UID (the medical code),
   name of speciality, category its under, and the description of the special.
   This is mainly used to help those who want to search by specific types of
   doctors for example a _"radiologist"_ is a term that a user could search and
   pull up information on such speciality and what category it is listed.
5. [Retrieve Insurance Providers and Plans](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/gmeGae) (`GET insurances`):

   This call returns a list with insurance providers and plans. A user can types
   in a plan or insurance company and details about their medical codes and type
   will show up for convenience. This is primarily used in relation with the
   `GET doctor` call in order to search by specific insurances and plans on those searches.
6. [Retrieve a List of known Conditions](https://codepen.io/palanen/pen/RpMLPL) (`GET conditions`):

   Returning a list of well-known conditions (such as medical illness or simple
   issues) that match up to the search term the user has provided. Such as a user
   typing in the term _"acne"_ and the call will result in the name of similar conditions,
   the medical code, and help with follow up information for the doctor search feature.

## Top-Level Design/Layout
All of the mockups are based on iOS Human Interface Guidelines which is highlighted
more in depth in the **Design Rationale** section.
The information provided on the images are short descriptions of what each Screen
does.  
   **Welcome Screen/Login page**
   ![alt text](welcome.png "Welcome Screen")
   These screens super simple and have big text, large images in order to direct
   the user where to look. Included in the application will be a login for patients
   and then for doctors (in order for them to input any missing information from
   the database to better searches) and also a sign up screen.

   **Search Pages**
   ![alt text](doctorsearchcards.png "Home search page")
   This is the **main** search page that users will be lead to as soon as they
   login to the application, it will randomly generate a list of doctors in their
   area based on their location (GPS will need to allowed to track this) and
   the user can scroll through.
   ![alt text](AdvancedSearch.png "Advance")
   This screen is shown when the user either presses the "Advance Search" button or when the user selects the menu tab and a slide out screen will appear with more options, listing advance search as one of the second options.
   ![alt text](SpecificSearch.png "Specific")
   Shown to a user after selecting a specific search and will lead them to this page to do a more detail search on what they need.

   **Doctor Profiles**
   ![alt text](DocProfile.png "Profile")
   Shown to user once they make a selection on a doctor they want from the other search pages.

   **User Profiles**
   ![alt text](UserAccountPage.png "User")
   This page can be accessed by selecting the "account" button from the menu button. This will lead the user to an area where they can edit their account details and personalize their experience and what kind of doctors will pull up for them on the front page of this app.
   ![alt text](SideProfileMenu.png "User")
   This is a side menu that is shown from selecting the menu button bars. Showcasing all the items the user can do within the app.

## Usage Scenarios

### Finding a new doctor with your specific insurance:
There several different ways on the application to complete this task.
 1. [Through the Advance search](goo.gl/PnKLgJ)

  - A user would type in the name of insurance provider such as "Athena" and then tap the arrow button to the lead user to the next screen that lists all the doctors that will match that search. A user will then select the doctor they like the most or closest to them by clicking on a doctor's name. Then it will lead the user to another page with the doctor's profile which will list all of their information.

  _To see a demo of this just click the link above and it will show it for a computer mock up. **TYPING DOES NOT WORK**, but the actions such as going to the next screens do._

 2. **Through the User Profile**

  - A user can go to their profile page and then edit the name their insurance. When the user goes back to the home page, the application will reload with only doctors that have that insurance and other specific details listed in user profile.

### Finding other doctors within the practice that specialize in your specific condition:
  - [Demo](https://goo.gl/radF6J)
  - A user can start from the home page and search in the search bar for a certain doctor. When the doctor they want appears in the "doctor search cards", the user can select the doctor and get lead to the doctor's profile page. There the user can see a map, the distance they are from the doctor and the location address. Selecting the address will lead to another screen that will search and list only the doctors that belong to that practice selected. Next the user can go to the "advanced search" button above and select a specific condition with the search still on the "doctors within the practice" tab. This will lead user to a "specific search page" will change depending on what was searched.

## Design Rationale
The Better Doctor Application is designed to be simple and easy to learn. It is
created toward people in the age range of 30 or older to help them find a medical
provider.

1. Prioritizing content with coordinating text sizes.

   Wanted people who were target for this application could clearly read and understand
   what was asked of them. Wanted the icons and selections to be front in center,
   in order to make guiding through this application an easy process. The use of large
   arrows and big text, simple fonts, is used to get the point across while also
   keeping a professional look to the app.

   As stated in Norman's book, Human error is not real. It is a _bad design choice_.
   wanting to get the best design possible in order to allow the user to understand
   what I (the designer) is wanting them to do in order to continue onto the next
   feature.
2. Keeping the theme to the BetterDoctor API

   I wanted to keep this application consistent with the BetterDoctor API theme, as the logo is a deep purple and the rest of the website is either gray or black. As stated in Apple's visual design: "**In general, choose a limited color palette that coordinates with your app logo.** Subtle use of color is a great way to communicate your brand." Following this guide, BetterDoctor follows the colors that are complimentary to the API site. Bringing in all the colors that will show its style, as well as not distracting from the main objective.

3. Having a minimalist theme

   Keeping the application clean and simple, dark colors was an important goal that I wanted. The application would be easier to read and to see with the darker colors and simple text on each screen.

### Following Apple's Human Interaction Guidelines:
I chose to follow Apple's guidelines in creating applications because iOS apps have always looked clean, simple, neat and put together. Following these guidelines allows the application to be an overall stronger app.

   - **Provide hints and context in search bars**:

     + This application has the search bar at the top of the screen and within the search there is a hint that reads "search by name, speciality, condition...", informing the users what exactly they need to type into that field. Leading to less errors as the user is prompted on what to do next.
     ![](searchtrigger.png)
     + All buttons within the application as well usually have text within them to let the user know what they do, as well as using a "focused" tab design which is a drop shadow to the back of the buttons or doctor cards to cue the user to the important information on the page.

     ![](focusedbuttons.png)
     + Also following the **guideline of using standard back buttons** to trigger that the user can go back on the page, along with the cancel button on the side.

     ![](buttons.png)
   - **Don't Display Too Many Pages | Design an information structure that makes it fast and easy to get to content**

     + The user can finish a task usually doing either two different ways to solve the task. When completing tasks, I tried to keep the search pages very organized. As the Advance search and the regular search are separated, the purpose of that is to have a general and non-general search for what the user wants. Within the Advanced search page, the user can selected several different categories at once to limit results on the next page that will lead to the perfect doctor for them.
     + Apple states, "Design an information structure that makes it easy and fast to get to the content", I did this by minimizing the amount of options the user has. Having the direct features/needs that the user needs leads to less errors as the user has it pointed out to them and organized in a clear way. Wanting to limit the amount of screens shown and taps needed to complete a task.
   - **Navigation bar on top of screen**

     + The navigation bar is displayed at the top of screen for connivence of the user. In order for the user to know how to get back to a page they want to re-visit, or to make edits on their profile. Having the navigation stay at the top of the screen cues to the user that they can also go back to other screens with a quick tap.

     ![](menu.png)

### Organization of Navigation

   - All the menus in the application have their actions listed from most important to list important. Some of the most used actions will be up at the beginning while actions that might be necessary, but not used as much at the bottom.
   - This allows for less errors as the users will have standardized tasks laid out in order of what is most important for usage.

## Usability Metric Forecast
- **Strongest Metrics**

   1. learnability
   2. efficiency
   3. Errors

   These would be the strongest metrics because this application is extremely simple to use, without much instruction a new user can jump right in and start searching for doctors without prior experience. One of the main objects to keep in mind when making an app easy to learn, is ways to make it simple and effective. So that the user is not only happy but understands what the designer is trying to do. And everything else falls into place with learnability, if the application is easy to use - it causes less errors for the user and they will want to use the application time after time because it is efficient which is another metric that is touched when it is clear and straight forward.
- **Weakest Metrics**

   This is a hard section to complete because I believe my dream application would have _no_ errors when tested and that everything goes smooth with users. But that is not real life. With testing and after getting feedback, I believe users would probably ask for more features, a better color scheme, and more personalized details added to the account section of the app. Which would lead to a weak satisfaction rating - as the application is convenient to use, it does not have everything and more. This might cause a bit of errors because there might be certain searches or features the user is looking for but is not available yet, those would be suggestions that I would need to take to improve the overall feel and look of the application.
   
   1. Satisfaction
   2. Errors
